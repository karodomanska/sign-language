# sign-language
A few RNN-based models for Polish Sign Language processing.

A part of the research for Bachelor's thesis - to launch an app to recognize sign language alphabet using recurrent neural networks and then to translate the signs. Pretty good to begin with when creating a bigger tool - reached circa 80% accuracy, although it may need some adjustments due to poor diversity of the dataset.
